This is original deskew plug-in for GIMP written by Karl Chen back in 2007. 
The plugin's homepage has been offline for a very long time, and the 
plug-in needed some fixes. So I went ahead and saved it from 
http://ccux-linux.de/pdb/index.php?pdetail=6271 where an src.rpm still had the 
original tarball.
